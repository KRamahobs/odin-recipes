    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      We’ve been perfecting this incredibly simple, from scratch recipe for
      years, so it’s guaranteed to deliver light, super fluffy pancakes every
      time. These easy pancakes call for a short list of ingredients that I bet
      you already have, which means you’ll never need a boxed mix again. The
      moment the pancake batter hits the skillet, it rises tall and fluffy. My
      recipe calls for milk. If you have buttermilk, I highly recommend this
      buttermilk pancake recipe. We love this recipe so much that is has
      inspired many of the pancake recipes on Inspired Taste.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ (195g) all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon aluminum-free baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon of fine sea or table salt</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups (295ml) milk</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons (70g) unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the butter</strong>: Melt the butter and set it aside to
        vool slightly
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Combine dry ingredients</strong>: In a medium bowl, whisk
        together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Combine wet ingredients</strong>: In a separate bowl, whisk
        together the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Don’t worry
        if the butter solidifies a little.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mix the batter</strong>: Create a well in the center of your dry
        ingredients. Pour the milk mixture into the well and gently whisk until
        the flour is just incorporated. A few small lumps are perfectly normal.
        As the batter rests, you should see it begin to bubble. It will be
        thick, like cake batter. If it seems too thick, add a splash more milk
        to thin it out.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Preheat the skillet</strong>: Place a large skillet or griddle
        over medium heat. To check if it's ready, sprinkle a few drops of water
        on the surface. They should “dance” around and evaporate quickly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the pancakes</strong>: Brush the skillet with melted butter
        for crispy edges (you can skip this if using a good nonstick pan). Scoop
        the batter onto the skillet using a 1/4 cup measure or a large cookie
        scoop, then gently spread each pancake into a 4-inch circle.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flip the pancakes</strong>: After 1 to 2 minutes, the edges will
        look dry, and bubbles will form and pop on the surface. Flip the
        pancakes and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes until they’re lightly
        browned and cooked through. Enjoy your pancakes right away with warm
        syrup, more butter, and berries.
